  <p style="max-width:800px;">Semantic HTML is what helps the browser and developer determine context and significance of web content. The tags are chosen and interpreted according to the inherent meaning (clearly defining content) rather than the appearance to a normal viewer. This aids in clarity to the browser as well as communicating with things such as search engines to make sure you get what you are searching for. Not only do they help with site structure, quality of site, and quality of workflow, but they can also help with accessibility and UI. Overall, HTML semantics are key to making sure that there is meaning to a webpage.</p>

  <p><b>Examples of Semantics:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>&lt;base&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;ol&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;code&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></li>
  </ul>
